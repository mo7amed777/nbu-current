# Launch Screen assets/images

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets/images by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/assets/images.xcassets/images` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.
